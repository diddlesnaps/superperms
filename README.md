This snap was created by the Ubuntu Podcast community. We would
be grateful if you could join the "Ubuntu Podcast" collective
for this search so we can "win", but this is optional. Please
also give the Ubuntu Podcast a listen in your podcatcher or
at https://ubuntupodcast.org/, and maybe join our Telegram
chatroom with an invite located at https://ubuntupodcast.org/telegram/

Statistics for the search and team leaderboard are available at

To run with your team set to Ubuntu Podcast:

`superperms team "Ubuntu Podcast"`

You can also specify a time limit in minutes to end your execution:

`superperms timeLimit 120 team "Ubuntu Podcast"`

A single client will use one CPU core, so if you want to dedicate
more CPU time to the search you need to run the client multiple
times - the standard is to run one client per CPU core in your PC.

This app will eat batteries on a laptop or tablet computer so it
is advisable not to run this on such devices if they are not
plugged-into a stable power outlet. The search will also produce
a lot of heat.

The source code for this client is at https://github.com/superpermutators/superperm

Ongoing discussion about the search is held in the Google Group at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/superpermutators
